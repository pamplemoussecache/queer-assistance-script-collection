# queer-assistance-script-collection

Hey all! This repo was started as a way to make it easier for folk to submit erroneous concerns & complaints to the [Missouri Attorney General's form](https://ago.mo.gov/file-a-complaint/transgender-center-concerns), which is encouraging folk to report trans people and medical providers. This is scary because it makes it harder for folks to trust their neighbors, will potentially increase the risk of prosecution for medical providers who are providing care to trans kids and adults, and will cause a deterioration in the support networks of the LGBTQ+ community in Missouri.
