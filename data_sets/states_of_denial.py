STATES_OF_DENIAL = [
    "Past atrocities may be genuinely unknown: the clandestine torture cells and unmarked mass graves. But within these societies, people usually know most such things - and the government knows that they know. The culture of state terror is neither secret nor openly acknowledged. Information circulates - neighbors witness disappearances or kidnappings, torture victims return to their families, newspaper readers know exactly what was censored - but is simultaneously denied. Fear inside depends on knowledge AND uncertainty: who will be picked up next? State legitimacy outside depends on permanent official denial.",
    "If the perpetrator is your own government, this must touch your own identity and political role.",
    "Some knowledge was clear even in the years before the war. When the social exclusion of Jews, gypsies, the mentally disabled and homosexuals became routinized, the expulsion and extermination stages were in sight, even apparently unconnected arms of government and business became involved... Doctors, lawyers, and other professionals played supporting roles.",
    "The SS used travel agents to book one-way passage to the camp at the rate of four Pfennig... per kilometer of track they would travel. Children under ten rode for half fare; those under four travelled free.",
    "I was just following orders... I had no choice... I couldn't have refused... I had nothing against these people, but they told us we had to kill them.' Such admissions come from underlings who implement rather than make policy, receive rather than give orders... The lower you are in the hierarchy, the easier it is to deny personal responsibility. You are the most passive recipient possilb,e at the end of a long chain of command, unable to exercise any initiative. But the higher you are in the authority structure (short of initiating the orders), the further you are from the end results.",
    'Once you overcome the initial moral restraints - the soldier kills his first civilian, the torturer first uses electric shock - then each subsequent step becomes easier. An account for stopping is harder to find, because this would question the earlier steps. Each step becomes a mechanical action, solely means-directed. In Calley\'s chilling words, each My Lai killing was "no big deal."',
    "But conformity to authority is itself an ideological value, just as the rhetoric of even the most dedicated perpetrators may digniy little more than obedience, ignorance, bad faith, pretence and self-deception. These states of mind combine or vacillate among themselves. The most dangerous is bad faith. In the moral void of state terror, perpetrators may adopt as their own belief that they are acting against their will.",
    "If obedience is a causal requirement of atrocities, so participating in atrocities creates obedience.",
    "Many societies, especially democratic ones, encourage a radical disjunction between belief and deed. People who are reluctant to do bad things, and find them awkward to justify, are given space to believe that what they say to themselves is not the same as what they do. ",
    "Some survivors and outside observers claim that prior contempt creates a shut-down mechanism, blinding perpetrators to the suffering they are inflicting. In the literal sense, however, most perpetrators are surely aware of the victim's suffering; this is what they want. Or an awareness intrudes, however dim, peripheral and momentary. If the suffering is then denied or neutralized, this is more a moral than a cognitive blindspot.",
    "[Discourse defending atrocity] may draw on just world thinking. In a just world, suffering is not random; innocent people do not get punished arbitrarily. They must have done something. They deserve to suffer because of what they did, must have done, support doing, or will do one day (if we don't act now). ",
    "It is interesting, but irrelevant, to contrast the unprincipled, obedient automaton, looking after number one, adopting any convenient motivational camoflage, with the fully informed, ideologically motivated monster, evil but acting out of principle. Both occupy the same moral void.",
    'SS-Man Ernst Gobel watches a soldier lift children (between two and six years old) by the hair, shoot them in the back of the head, and throw them in a grave. "After a while I just could not watch this any more and I told him to stop. What I meant was that he should not lift the children up by the hair, he should kill them in a more decent way."',
    "The function of euphemistic labels and jargon is to mask, sanitize and confer respectability. Palliative terms deny or misrepresent cruelty or harm, giving them neutral or respectable status.",
    "The enigmas of denial and bad faith are encoded within the language we use to converse with ourselves about atrocities and suffering. Thepublic texts of perpetrators and their apologies hardly need much decoding: listen to a spokesperson, political leader, or bureaucrat come out with the usual patent lies, desperate evasions, subtle half-truths, pathetic reassurances, convenient fictions, absurd analogies. Where are these people in that cognitive space between knowing and not-knowing that they are lying? Perhaps they have already entered a post-modern version of the Oedipal state: knowing and non-knowing at the same time, but also not caring.",
    "The unfolding perception of the Final Solution by European Jews themselves has become a prototype of collective denial. In the thirties, few people took Hitler's rhetoric seriously. Nazism was seen as a temporary phenomenon, a set-back to be endured until it passed. In Germany each new anti-Jewish measure, each escalation in persecution, was seen as the last. Even as the massacres started, rumours, then confirmed reports and survivor stories, were all disbelieved.",
    "There is no situation of total passivity. Not even fear, ideology, religion or ethnic loyalty can coerce everyone into permanent acquescence. Commitments and attitudes change over time. Recollections of previous silence and collusion now feel shameful. A sense of human decency or a sudden impulse can override, in an instant, the heaviest political pressure to keep silent.",
    'Even before the killings, they willingly identified, isolated and helped to transport the victims to the killing sites. They took over jobs, moved into houses, and stole possessions. On the two nights of 25 and 26 June 1940, some 3,800 Jews were killed in Kovna by local Lithuanian partisans. A visiting German officer records that on the next day he "became witness" to "probably the most frightful event" he had seen over two world wars: a blond man standing at a petrol station, a wooden club in his hand; at his feet, fifteen to twenty dead or dying people, their blood being washed away by a hose. The man then gives a "cursory wave" to the next in line of men guarded by civilians; he clubs the man to death, "each blow accompanied by enthusiastic shouts from the audience." A German photographer comes across the same scene: the young Luthuanian has now finished killing forty-five to fifty people; he puts the crowbar aside, fetches an accordian and, standing on a pile of corpses, plays the Lithuanian national anthem; the local people (including women and children) join in singing and clapping. Nearly all the bystanders are German soldiers. According to their statements the locals and the German administrative officials and police officers did not see anything. Only the photos exist.',
    "Because the regime is captive to its own lies, it must falsify everything.",
    'Social scientists have created plausible "genocide early warning systems," but the political buildup and signs (dehumanization, segregation, exclusion) are difficult to depict and easy to minimize. ',
